# coding-challenge

  - Please review the code inside the `challenge` folder
  - Specifically the file `challenge/src/App.js`
  - I added `docker` files because my local machine has an older version of `nodejs`, and it conflicts with latest version of `create-react-app`.


##### To start the app in your local machine, follow these steps, in root of the project:
```bash
# resolve dependecies
docker-compose run app yarn

# start the dev server
docker-compose up start
```
